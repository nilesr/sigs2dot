# A sucessor of sig2dot

The similarly named project [sig2dot](http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/sig2dot/) was last updated in 2002, and it does not currently function.

This is a small replacement project. Simply run `make` and you're all set.

For more fine grained control, the usage is as follows

    python3 sigs2dot.py [sigsfile] > graph.dot

where sigsfile contains the output of `gpg --list-sigs`
